# VERSION OVERVIEW
## VERSION 1:
In this version, we created the basic part of the project. We made an Airport class that stores the airport code, its location (latitude and longitude), and whether it is in the Schengen area. We also added functions to work with this data: we can load airports from a file, add new airports, remove airports, and check if an airport is in Schengen using its code.
We also added functions to save only the Schengen airports into a file and to show the information of each airport clearly on the screen. To make the program easier to understand, we created a plot that shows the number of Schengen and non-Schengen airports. We also added a map in Google Earth to show where the airports are, using different colors for each type.
Finally, we built a simple interface using Tkinter so users can use all the features easily. With this interface, users can load data, manage airports, see the plots, and open the map in a clear and easy way.

## VERSION 2:
In this version, we added the management of flights arriving to Barcelona (LEBL). We created an Aircraft class that stores the aircraft ID, the airline, the origin airport, and the arrival time.
We added functions to work with this data: we can load flights from a file, save them into a file, and ignore lines with incorrect data. We also created different plots such as the number of flights per hour, the number of flights per airline, and a comparison between flights coming from Schengen and non-Schengen countries.
We also added a map in Google Earth to show the routes of the flights from their origin to Barcelona, using different colors depending on whether they come from Schengen countries or not.
In addition, we implemented a function to detect long-distance flights (more than 2000 km), which may need special attention.
Finally, we updated the interface so users can use all these new features easily, including loading flight data, saving it, viewing plots, and displaying routes on the map.

## VERSION 3:
In this version, we introduced the management of boarding gates at Barcelona airport (LEBL). We defined new classes: BarcelonaAP, Terminal, BoardingArea, and Gate to represent the entire airport structure.
We implemented functionalities to load the airport structure from a file and automatically read airline terminal assignments from specific terminal files. The tool can now intelligently assign a free gate to an arriving flight by checking its airline terminal and verifying if it requires a Schengen or non-Schengen boarding area.  Additionally, we fixed and improved several things from the previous versions: We fully added comments using hashtags inside the code, added filters for the plots, fixed the long-distance calculation function (LongDistanceArrivals) and extended the interface so users can easily build the LEBL airport structure, assign gates to arriving flights, and view gate occupancy. However, integrating Google Earth directly inside the interface remains a pending task for the next delivery, as it currently still opens in a separate window.
